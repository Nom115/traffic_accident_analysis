## Installation 

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation 

This project is part of my business/data analysis portfolio. The project aims to apply CRISP-DM process in analytics of data of my choice. I have chosen the [Traffic Accident Data]. Using this data I have tried to answer the following question:

1. How does the road surface condition impact accident severity, considering other factors?

## File Descriptions

There is one Jupyter Notebook file that contains all the analytics and codes. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

## Results

You can find brief results below: 

1. How does the road surface condition impact accident severity, considering other factors?

The reason for a large majority of accidents occuring at a lower speed (30), is due to the lack of flow when driving at these speeds. As seen earlier, most accidents occured on single carriageway roads, and now most frequently at 30 MPH. In context, this could be due to constant accelerating and decceleration of vehicles, creating an unpredictable driving environment.

- Only one question was completed on this data-set, as the data-set was low quality and did not have great maturity for use in ML methods.
